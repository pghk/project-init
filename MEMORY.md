# Project Memory

## Current State
This is a bash project initializer called `project-init` that creates new development projects with boilerplate files and git initialization.

## Implemented Features
- `get_memorable_word()` function that returns a random memorable word for folder naming
- `generate_folder_name()` function that creates unique folder names with brief date (YMM) and memorable word
- `create_project_directory()` function that creates project directories with generated or specified names
- `generate_boilerplate_files()` function that creates standard project files from templates in a directory (treats all template files uniformly)
- `create_project_with_boilerplate()` function that creates directories and populates them with boilerplate files
- `initialize_git_repository()` function that initializes git repositories with initial commits
- `create_project_with_git()` function that creates complete project setup with directory, boilerplate files, and git repository
- `main()` function that handles command-line interface and script execution with clean output (demonstration messages removed)
- `show_help()` function that displays comprehensive usage information with proper script name
- Complete command-line interface with argument parsing and error handling
- Initial git commit functionality that creates commits with all boilerplate files
- Memorable words array with 26 carefully selected words (alpha through zulu)
- Professional script naming: renamed from `script.sh` to `project-init` for better command-line usage
- Comprehensive test suite using bats framework with 13 focused, maintainable test cases:
  - Tests folder names are brief, memorable, and filesystem-safe
  - Tests folder names are chronologically sortable within 10-year span
  - Tests folder names provide uniqueness through variation

  - Tests creation of all required boilerplate files with appropriate content
  - Tests integrated project creation with boilerplate works end-to-end
  - Tests git repository initialization with proper initial commit
  - Tests complete project creation with git integration works end-to-end
  - Tests main script supports all design requirements through command-line interface
  - Tests main script handles custom directory names and error cases
  - Tests template system provides consistent boilerplate structure
  - Tests template directory fallback system works with environment variable and smart defaults
  - Tests template directory search prioritizes paths correctly

## Project Structure

- `get_memorable_word()` returns one of 26 carefully selected memorable words
- `generate_folder_name()` uses last digit of year plus month (YMM format) with memorable word
- `create_project_directory()` creates directories and handles errors gracefully
- `generate_boilerplate_files()` copies template files to create README.md, TODO.md, MEMORY.md, and AGENT.md files (all templates handled uniformly)
- `find_templates_directory()` searches for templates with smart fallback system supporting environment variable override
- `create_project_with_boilerplate()` combines directory creation with file generation
- `initialize_git_repository()` initializes git repositories with proper error handling
- `create_project_with_git()` provides complete project setup including git repository initialization
- Folder name format: YMM-memorableword (e.g., "506-lima" for June 2025)
- Script is executable with proper shebang line and renamed to `project-init` for professional command-line usage
- Boilerplate files include appropriate content templates for new projects
- AGENT.md is created from the generalized template file for language-agnostic development guidelines (handled uniformly with other templates)
- Template files are stored in `templates/` directory for better maintainability
- Template directory discovery with smart fallback system: PROJECT_INIT_TEMPLATES env var, ./templates, ~/.config/project-init/templates/, /usr/local/share/project-init/templates/
- AGENT.md template is generalized for any programming language/framework (not bash-specific)
- Boilerplate generation uses file copying from templates instead of heredocs
- Clean implementation focused on project initialization behavior
- Function names and comments focus on what they do, not how they do it
- Tests focus on behavioral requirements rather than implementation details
- Flexible design allows for future changes to word selection algorithm
- Directory creation includes error handling for existing directories
- Boilerplate generation includes error handling for non-existent directories and missing template files
- Template directory fallback system provides robust template discovery with clear error messages
- Functions return created directory name on success, error messages on failure
- Git initialization uses `git init --quiet` for clean operation
- Git functions handle non-existent directories and existing repositories gracefully
- Complete project creation now includes git repository initialization with initial commit by default
- Git initialization includes automatic user configuration for commits
- Initial commits include all boilerplate files with descriptive commit message using gitmoji
- Git functions handle existing repositories by adding new files and creating additional commits
- Test suite designed to be flexible and focus on behavioral requirements rather than rigid implementation details
- Command-line interface supports help flags (--help, -h, help) with comprehensive usage information
- Main function provides user-friendly output with confirmation messages and proper exit codes
- Error handling includes meaningful messages for common failure scenarios
- Script creates projects with clear feedback messages when run without arguments
- Proper argument validation with usage display for invalid inputs
- Script executable as standalone command-line tool without requiring bash invocation
- Environment variable PROJECT_INIT_TEMPLATES allows custom template directory specification
- Help documentation includes template directory configuration and environment variable usage
- Enhanced main function output with emoji indicators and detailed project creation feedback
- Test suite refactored for maximum flexibility - removed specific output text matching in favor of behavioral verification (exit codes, directory creation, file presence)
- Tests now focus on essential functionality rather than output formatting, making them more resilient to UI changes

## Project Complete
