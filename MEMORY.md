# Project Memory

## Current State
This is a bash project initializer that creates new development projects with boilerplate files.

## Implemented Features
- `get_nato_word()` function in `script.sh` that returns a random NATO alphabet word
- NATO alphabet array with all 26 code words (Alpha through Zulu)
- Comprehensive test suite using bats framework with 3 test cases:
  - Validates returned word is from NATO alphabet
  - Ensures non-empty return value
  - Tests multiple function calls work correctly

## Project Structure
- `script.sh`: Main bash script with NATO alphabet functionality
- `test.sh`: Bats test framework file with comprehensive tests
- `README.md`: Project description and overview
- `TODO.md`: Task tracking (NATO alphabet task completed)
- `AGENT.md`: Development rules and guidelines
- `MEMORY.md`: This file - project state tracking

## Technical Details
- Uses bash RANDOM variable for random index generation
- Script can be sourced for function access or run directly for demonstration
- All tests passing with bats framework
- Function returns one of 26 valid NATO phonetic alphabet words

## Next Steps
The NATO alphabet functionality is complete and tested. The project needs additional features to fulfill its goal as a project initializer (creating folders, boilerplate files, git initialization).
